## Usage

Clone the repo and open 'index.html' in your browser.

## Lessons Learned

* Event listeners should only be invoked once -- This caused more headaches than I care to admit.

* Visual feedback does wonders for user experience

## Development Goals

This project is finished and will probably not receive any future updates.
