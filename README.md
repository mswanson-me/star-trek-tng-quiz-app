# star-trek-tng-quiz-app

Quiz apps aren't really exciting, but they do involve quite a bit. While this is a boot camp project, it is not a 'code by numbers' kind of thing.

## Usage

Clone the repo and open 'index.html' in your browser.

## Lessons Learned

* Event listeners should only be invoked once -- This caused more headaches than I care to admit.
* When possible, start with the data structure -- Having a solid data structure can inform a lot of good design choices.
* Visual feedback does wonders for user experience

## Development Goals

This project is finished and will probably not receive any future updates.
